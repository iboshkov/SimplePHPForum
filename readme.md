# Simple PHP Forum

This is a small project I'm doing for a few classes this semester, might as well open source it.

Currently a work in progress it's far from complete at the time of writing.

Uses/will use:

- Laravel for the backend REST API
- Angular 1.5 for frontend client-side interactivity and communication with the API
- Semantic UI
- Satellizer + Laravel Passport for authentication
- CKEditor + [my patched fork of angular-ckeditor](https://github.com/iboshkov/angular-ckeditor), should move
into a bower package.
- Some extra JS and PHP libraries (see package.json and composer.json)

Meant to be used with Homestead during development (Homestead.yaml and Vagrantfile provided).
